    "# UCI Data Set: Person Income Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "  This data set contains weighted census data extracted from the 1994 and 1995 current population surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The data contains 41 demographic and employment related variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The instance weight indicates the number of people in the population that each record represents due to stratified sampling. To do real analysis and derive conclusions, this field must be used. This attribute should *not* be used in the classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  One instance per line with comma delimited fields. There are 199523 instances in the data file and 99762 in the test file.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The data was split into train/test in approximately 2/3, 1/3 proportions using MineSet's MIndUtil mineset-to-mlc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction Task\n",
    "  Prediction task is to determine the income level for the person represented by the record.  Incomes have been binned at the $50K level to present a binary classification problem, much like the original UCI/ADULT database.  The goal field of this data, however, was drawn from the \"total person income\" field rather than the \"adjusted gross income\" and may, therefore, behave differently than the orginal ADULT goal field.\n",
